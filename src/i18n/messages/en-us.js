Taking a <chm>tour of Computer History museum</chm>, and going to various conferences also added to my motivation. I'm originally from Russia and one can say that <yndx>Yandex</yndx> is Google's Russian cousin. That's why I decided to study web development with <ypen>Yandex Practicum</ypen> (<ypru>Russian branch</ypru>) - their educational startup. I like to write code using Oculus Quest 2 VR headset, nature, meditation, music and improv comedy. I got my Bachelor's in Business Administration from University of Connecticut.",
